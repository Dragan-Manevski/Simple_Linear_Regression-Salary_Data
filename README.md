# Simple Linear Regression - Salary Data
### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Linear Regression:
- an **algorithm**:
    - based on **Supervised Learning**
    - where machines **learn with supervision**
    - **input data are labeled** and **expected output data is known**
    - used **to predict continuous (quantitative) numeric output value (y) based on given continuous (quantitative) numeric input variable(s) (x)**
    - where using the **linear relationship between numeric dependent output variable (y) (target) and independent input variable(s) (x) (predictor(s))**, we try **to find the best fit line (equation)** that can be used to make predictions
    - **best fit line** is known as **Regression line** and is represented by a **linear equation**:
                                        
                                        Y = a * X + b
                              where,

                                        Y - dependent variable we are trying to predict
                                        X - independent variable we are using to make predictions
                                        a, b - coefficients of Linear Regression equation (line)
                                        a - slope, which represents the effect X has on Y
                                        b - intercept, which is a constant

- **regression analysis** is a **predictive modeling technique**
- **types** of Linear Regression:
  - **Simple Linear Regression** is a linear relationship between a single independent input variable (x) and corresponding dependent output variable (y)
  - **Multiple Linear Regression** is a linear relationship between 2 or more independent input variables (x) and corresponding output dependent variable (y)
- **examples** of Linear Regression problems:
  - House price
  - Weather forecast
  - Process optimization
  - Number of calls
  - Total sales

### Project Objective: Predicting salary of employee
Create a model that allows returning back an estimate of the salary of an employee given how many years of experience they have. Information about the salaries is in the dataset 'Salary_Data.csv' of 'Data' folder.

The Salary Data dataset contains the following columns:
- **YearsExperience** - number of years of experience (independent variable)
- **Salary** - respective salary of each employee (dependent variable)
